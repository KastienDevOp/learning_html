                            The art software that I am working on is for a close friend. He's an artist and I love giving to the community so in addition to learning html,
                            I am also furthering my studies in Python using SQLite3, JSON, PySide6, and Time (all Python Libraries) to achieve the goal of software that will
                            run his entire company from his personal computer or smartphone. It will have things like payroll, galleries that are separated under each artist,
                            or sub-artists' name on the company's website homepage, and much more. From being able to upload an image for anyone to see, to being able to
                            buy/sell art right at the click of a button no matter where he is, or his partners are, while out and about handling day to day business. This
                            software will also, in the future, be able to track his companies financial records, have a self-learning API that will automatically help him
                            adjust his companies budget to see where he can save money, and spend more, and finally the software will be able to track inventory
                            (given that he opens a studio) and keeps supplies handy for him and his fellow artists of whom he hires to be able to use.
